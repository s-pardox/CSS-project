## _Debirdifycation_ and the rise of Mastodon: a Computational Social Science analysis of the Twitter exodus.

## Introduction

Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs), with Mastodon as a significant representative, are emerging as compelling alternatives to traditional centralized platforms in the dynamic landscape of social media. "This research examines the rise in Mastodon user registrations following major social media events related to Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition. It explores migration trends, user behaviors, and associated themes, shedding light on the implications for the digital social landscape."

The full paper detailing this research is available [here](https://github.com/s-pardox/CSS-project/blob/main/CSS-final-project.pdf).

## Research Questions

This project aims to address the following research questions:

### RQ1: How do key events related to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter correlate with a surge in user registrations on Mastodon?
`
This research investigates the relationship between pivotal developments in Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter and the subsequent increase in user registrations on Mastodon. By exploring a temporal window surrounding the acquisition, the study aims to offer insights into potential migration trends and the impact of significant events.

### RQ2: How does the activity of newcomers correlate with the daily enrollment rate on Mastodon?

This research question focuses on the engagement levels of newcomers on Mastodon and their correlation with the daily rate of new user registrations. The analysis aims to determine if an increase in user registrations corresponds to a proportional rise in platform activity.

### RQ3: What are the primary themes and patterns in user motivations for migrating from Twitter to Mastodon?

This question explores user discourse through content analysis of tweets and 'toots' tagged with _#mastodonmigration_ and _#twittermigration_. The aim is to identify prevalent themes in users' self-disclosed motivations for transitioning between platforms.
